## Abstract
This work presents a novel and complete resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis. We define a Hermitian operator based on the second derivative of the log modulus of the Riemann zeta function. Its eigenvalue spectrum aligns with the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s), satisfying the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture and revealing the critical line as a natural outcome of standing wave resonance dynamics.

Numerical simulations and graphical overlays confirm this correspondence. The approach connects spectral theory, number theory, and harmonic dynamics to establish a resonant origin for the critical line structure.
